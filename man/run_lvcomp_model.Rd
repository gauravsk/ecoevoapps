\title{Run the Lotka-Volterra competition model (with carrying capacity and relative effects)}
\usage{
run_lvcomp_model(time, init, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{vector of time units over which to run model, starting from 0.
`time` can also be supplied as just the total length of the simulation (i.e. tmax)}

\item{init}{vector of initial population sizes for both species, with names N1 and N2}

\item{params}{vector of model parameters
Note that carrying capacity for both species can be defined in `params`
either as `K1` and `K2`, or in the inverse, as `a11` and `a22`.
If carrying capacities are defined as `K1` and `K2`, interspecific competition
should be defined as `a` and `b`; otherwise, `a12` and `a21`.}
